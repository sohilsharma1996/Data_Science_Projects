From the table data, we can see that the aircraft fuel expense for 2018 was $9.896 million, which is 23.6% of the total operating expenses. So, to find the total operating expenses, we can set up the equation: Total Operating Expenses = Aircraft Fuel Expense / (Percentage of Total Operating Expenses / 100). Substituting the values, we get Total Operating Expenses = $9.896 million / (23.6 / 100) = $41.9 million. Therefore, the total operating expenses in 2018 were $41.9 million.\n"
